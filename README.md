# Minesweeper Game and Auto-solver

Just a small little project for me to relearn Java and learn JavaFx.

To run, navigate to the build directory in the terminal and run "java Main" without quotation marks. 

Controls are left click to clear a mine, right click on an unopened square to flag a mine, right click on an opened square to auto-click known squares. Number of remaining mines is shown in the top left corner.
